# 🌾 Yield Prediction Using Random Forest

## Hey there! 👋

I made this project to explore how **machine learning can help farmers** predict crop yield. Basically, you feed it some data about soil, weather, and other factors, and it tells you roughly how much crop to expect. I used **Random Forest** because it’s simple to understand, yet surprisingly effective.

Along the way, I poked around the data, trained a model, and even built a small **web app** so you don’t need to touch any code to try it out. It’s been a fun little journey! 🌱💻

## 📂 What’s Inside This Repo

Here’s a quick rundown:

* **1. Yield Data Analysis.ipynb** → I played with the data, checked patterns, and made some charts. Pretty fun to see trends emerge! 📊
* **2. Yield Data ML.ipynb** → Built the Random Forest model here. This is where the magic happens. 🌳
* **app.py** → Streamlit web app so anyone can plug in values and get predictions instantly.
* **harvest-280.gif** → A little fun visual I threw in just for style. 🎉
* **requirements.txt** → Python packages you’ll need.
* **yield_df.csv** → The dataset used for training/testing.

## 🏃‍♂️ Using the Project

### Notebooks

Open Jupyter Notebook and run these in order:

1. `1. Yield Data Analysis.ipynb`
2. `2. Yield Data ML.ipynb`

You’ll see the data, the graphs, and the model building steps in action.

### Web App

Run it locally:

```bash
python app.py
```

A browser window pops up where you can enter values and get **instant yield predictions**. Super simple! 🌾✨
