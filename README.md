# Yield Prediction Using Random Forest

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict agricultural yield using machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest algorithm. The project includes data analysis, model training, and a web application for predictions.

---
## Project Structure
- **1. Yield Data Analysis.ipynb**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset.
- **2. Yield Data ML.ipynb**: Machine learning model development for yield prediction.
- **app.py**: A Python-based web application for making predictions.
- **harvest-280.gif**: A visualization related to the project.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required dependencies.
- **yield_df.csv**: The dataset used for training and evaluation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Yield_RF.git
   cd Yield_RF-main
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
---
## Usage
### Running the Jupyter Notebooks
To analyze and train the model, open the Jupyter notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Then, run `1. Yield Data Analysis.ipynb` followed by `2. Yield Data ML.ipynb`.

---
### Running the Web App
To launch the web application:
```bash
python app.py
```
This will start a local server where you can input data and get yield predictions.

---
## Dependencies
All required dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
