# 🌾 Yield Prediction Using Random Forest

## 🚀 Overview

Hey there! 👋
This is a little project I did to explore how machine learning can help in agriculture. The main goal is to **predict crop yield** based on some input features like soil, weather, and other factors. I used **Random Forest**, which is surprisingly powerful and pretty fun to play with.

Along the way, I explored the data, built a model, and even made a simple **web app** so anyone can test predictions without touching code. 🌱💻

## 📂 Project Structure

Here’s a quick peek at what’s inside:

* **1. Yield Data Analysis.ipynb** → Where I played with the data, explored patterns, and made some cool charts. 📊
* **2. Yield Data ML.ipynb** → The notebook where I built and trained the Random Forest model. 🌳
* **app.py** → Streamlit web app so you can enter values and see predicted yields instantly.
* **harvest-280.gif** → Just a fun little GIF to make the repo look lively. 🎉
* **requirements.txt** → All Python packages you’ll need.
* **yield_df.csv** → Dataset used for training/testing.

## ⚡ Installation

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Yield_RF.git
   cd Yield_RF-main
   ```

2. **(Optional but recommended) Set up a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

### Notebooks

Open Jupyter Notebook and run the notebooks in this order:

1. `1. Yield Data Analysis.ipynb`
2. `2. Yield Data ML.ipynb`

### Web App

Run locally with:

```bash
python app.py
```

Your browser will open a nice interface where you can **input values and see yield predictions instantly**! 🌾✨
